### About Me

Hello! I'm Frank Santos, a 33-year-old senior backend developer, married and a father of two daughters. Currently, I work at the Zup consultancy, where I'm allocated to the Ita√∫ client, working on the modernization of the discounted risk pipeline.

My philosophy in software development is that each language has its ideal purpose and application. Although I currently dedicate myself to Java and Python, I keep myself constantly updated on market trends. Particularly, I have great interest in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) market and the numerous applications that this technology will bring in the future.

### Experience with Languages

Although I don't limit myself to a single language, I have significant experience with the following technologies:

-   Java - 2017-present
-   Javascript - 2017-2021
-   Python - 2021-present

### Professional Experience

**1. Fullstack Development Intern - Fatec**

In this role, I actively participated in the development of the system for the Inova Paula Souza Challenge, with the responsibility of recreating the system that had previously suffered an intrusion.

**Technologies Used:** Java (JSP, DAO), JavaScript, jQuery, AngularJS, PostgreSQL.

**Main Challenge:** In addition to the rapid learning curve of the technologies involved, the biggest challenge was to implement a full-text search functionality using PostgreSQL.

**2. Fullstack Developer (Intern/Mid-Level/Senior) - AGE Desenvolvimento de Sistemas**

In this stage, I worked on the development of new functionalities, maintenance, and bug fixes. Later, I migrated to a team focused on AWS cloud solutions, where I was able to implement improvements using this platform.

**Technologies Used:** Java, JavaScript, Struts 1 and 2, Spring with Thymeleaf, Micronaut, MySQL, DynamoDB, Redis.

**Main Challenge:** The transition to the Engineering team was a milestone. I carried out several PoCs (Proofs of Concept) and led the modernization of the notification system. I implemented a robust notification architecture using AWS services such as Lambda, SQS, DynamoDB, and WebSockets. Additionally, I integrated push notifications to optimize costs.

**3. Backend Developer (Mid-Level/Senior) - Zup**

Currently, I'm working as a Backend Developer at Zup, where my responsibilities include creating, ideating, and designing architectures, as well as maintaining and fixing bugs. I also provide guidance and support to team members whenever necessary.

**Technologies Used:** Java, Spring, Python, Clean Architecture, MySQL, DynamoDB, Terraform, CloudFormation, GitHub Actions.

**Main Challenge:** I consider that the biggest challenge was creating a complete system from scratch in collaboration with my team. This involved implementing observability and constantly analyzing the trade-offs in the day-to-day. In addition, we faced significant challenges when working with partners, especially when the documentation provided was not adequate.
